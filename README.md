# 🚲 Cyclistic Case Study – Data Analysis

This project is part of the portfolio of **J. Daniel Marin**, developed as the final capstone for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. It analyzes user behavior in a bike-share system to support marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## 🧠 Business Task

The fictional company **Cyclistic** aims to increase the number of annual members, as they provide more consistent revenue. The goal of this case study is to analyze how **casual riders** differ from **annual members** in their usage patterns, to inform targeted marketing efforts.

## 📁 Dataset

Two public datasets from Divvy Bike Share (Chicago) were used, corresponding to the first quarters of 2019 and 2020:

- `Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv`
- `Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv`

## 🧰 Tools and Packages

- Language: **R**
- Environment: **RStudio**
- Key packages:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `lubridate`
  - `hms`
  - `ggplot2`

## 🔧 Workflow

1. **Data import and exploration**
2. **Column standardization**
3. **Cleaning and merging datasets**
4. **Calculation of metrics (ride duration, weekday use, monthly trends)**
5. **Data visualization**

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Casual riders** tend to take longer trips, especially on weekends.
